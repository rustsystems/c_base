[c Assignment]
CI:AV.[AutomationRequest]&
AV:{TM,AS,TK01,RA,PB}.[UniqueAutomationRequest]&
*1 TK01
For each eligible entity, calculate the
planning points required to calculate
task costs:
1) Request sensor footprint information
for all eligible vehicles (if required)
2) Find task options and composition.
3) For each option, calculate planning

*1
TK01:=RA.[RouteRequest](cost only)&
*1 RA 
Based on entity requirements, send
requests to planners to calculate
costs for all of the task options.

TK01:={RA,AS}.[TaskPlanOptions]&
*1 RA 
After receiving all TaskPlanOptions
(requested in the AutomationRequest)
request costs for plans from each entity
to each eligible task and from each task
to every other task.

Plan Costs, from all of the requested
tasks, are received.
