Even if the previous advisory was “weak right”, the presence of
a nearby intruder will cause the network to output a “strong left” advisory
instead.

– Input constraints: 2000 ≤ ρ ≤ 7000, −0.4 ≤ θ ≤ −0.14, −3.141592 ≤ ψ ≤
−3.141592 + 0.01, 100 ≤ vown ≤ 150, 0 ≤ vint ≤ 150.
– Desired output property: the score for “strong left” is minimal.
