If the intruder is directly ahead and is moving away from the
ownship but at a lower speed than that of the ownship, the score for COC
will not be minimal.

– Input constraints: 1500 ≤ ρ ≤ 1800, −0.06 ≤ θ ≤ 0.06, ψ = 0, v_own ≥ 1000,
700 ≤ v_int ≤ 800.
– Desired output property: the score for COC is not the minimal score.
