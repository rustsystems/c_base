These are the well-studied ACAXU benchmarks from "Reluplex: An efficient SMT solver for verifying deep neural networks" by Katz, Guy, et al., CAV 2017.

To run a specific bencmark, such as network 3-3 with property 9, execute 'python3 acasxu_single.py 3 3 9'

To run all the benchmarks, run acasxu_all.py (results summary file is placed in results folder).
