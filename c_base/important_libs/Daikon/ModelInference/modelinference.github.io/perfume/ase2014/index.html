    <h1>Perfume (ASE 2014 supplementary content)</h1>

    <div class="sectiontext">
      This page contains supplementary content for the Perfume paper,
      <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/brun/pubs/pubs/Ohmann14ase.pdf">
      Behavioral Resource-Aware Model Inference</a>, which was published at the
      29th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering
      (ASE14). Learn more at the <a href="../">Perfume main page</a>.

      All models referenced below are event-based FSMs, as Perfume currently
      outputs models in this form. While models shown in the ASE 2014 paper
      are state-based instead, these models could be trivially converted to
      state-based models by pushing each node's event type into its outgoing
      or incoming edges. The former strategy should be used if events in the
      log were recorded as they were starting, while the latter should be
      used if events were logged as they finished.
