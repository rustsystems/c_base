/** RatTerm is an immutable record type representing a term in a
    polynomial expression.  The term has the form coeff * x^expt.
    <p>

    A RatTerm can be notated by the pair (C . E),
    where C is the string representation of t.coeff, and E is t.expt.
    <p>

    For a given RatTerm r, "coefficient of r" is synonymous with
    r.coeff, and likewise "exponent of r" is synonymous with r.expt.
    <p>

    (1 . 3), (3/4 . 17), (7/2 . -1), and (NaN . 74) are all valid
    RatTerms, corresponding to the polynomial terms "x^3", "3/4*x^17",
    "7/2*x^-1" and "NaN*x^74", respectively.
