# Sample Testing file

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
created node n1 with cost 5
created node n2 with cost 5
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print some stuff
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are: 

# Find a path
shortest path in graph1: n1 n2
