To reduce the number of goal file differences, I haved committed the 
'incorrect' comp.goal file.  If and when this problem is fixed,
we can compare the revised results to comp.goal.386.

MultiDimArrayTest.comp and MultiDimArrayTest.invs fail (64 bits only)
due to the 'multiple struct members in a single register' problem.
This will require a significant amount of work in Kvasir to repair.

The fault is that globalBoo.a and globalBoo.b are incorrectly placed
in the same invariant set.

-::globalBoo ::globalBoo.a
-::globalBoo.b
+::globalBoo ::globalBoo.a ::globalBoo.b
