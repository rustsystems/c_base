This test is intentionally a little strange to demonstrate a potential
problem with unions in Kvasir.  The program contains a union of a
char* and ptr*.  The ptr (next) is assigned an address giving the 
char* (name) random garbage.  Hence, the .dtrace file will almost
never match.  You should verify it contains only differences of
the form:


 ::comp_test_ptr[..].comp.name
-[ "(4321" ]
+[ "(`4321" ]
...
 ::comp_test_ptr[..].comp.next->name
-[ "(4321" ]
+[ "(`4321" ]
