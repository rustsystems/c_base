To reduce the number of goal file differences, I haved committed the 
'incorrect' comp.goal file.  If and when this problem is fixed,
we can compare the revised results to comp.goal.386.

ArrayTest.comp fails (64 bits only) due to the 'multiple struct members
in a single register' problem.
This will require a significant amount of work in Kvasir to repair.

The fault is that C.baz_head and bar_head are incorrectly placed
in the same invariant set.

-::eightA[..].B[1]->C.baz_head
+::eightA[..].B[1]->C.baz_head ::eightA[..].B[1]->bar_head
-::eightA[..].B[1]->bar_head

Similarly, age and middleName are incorrectly associated.

-::population[..].age
+::population[..].age ::population[..].middleName
-::population[..].middleName
