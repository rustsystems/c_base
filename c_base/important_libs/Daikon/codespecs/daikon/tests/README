This directory contains Daikon's regression tests.  (The Daikon unit tests
are separate and can be found in directory java/daikon/test/ in the main
repository and distribution.)

As is the case with many parts of this system, typing 'make help' at the
prompt will list the options available to you.

The primary target you will use is 'make diffs'.  This command runs
all of the regression tests and displays the results at the end.  The
final output of the command is a listing of all of the difference
files.  You can inspect the list for non-empty files, and investigate
them more fully.

You may also find 'make summary' useful.  It simply displays the
difference file sizes (without re-running any tests).

Since the full suite takes so long to run, you may wish to only check
one program for regressions.  You can do that by changing to some
subdirectory and running the Makefile from there.  As usual, 'make
help' will list the options available to you.  The target you will use
in subdirectories is 'make diffs' or 'make txt-diff'.

If you have suggestions for this system, please do share them.
