GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro
processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters
to macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files,
running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU
`m4' for generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

GNU `m4' was originally written by Rene' Seindal, from Denmark.

GNU `m4' has a web site at http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/.

This repository has several branches.  The one you have checked out

- branch-1.6: Some improvements to 1.4, but not yet finalized and released
- branch-2.0: Many new experimental features, hasn't been worked on in years

For any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package
