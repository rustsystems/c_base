Gnulib module: extensions

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is planned to be removed from POSIX and to be deprecated
in glibc.  Portable applications should use @code{readdir}.
@item
This function has an incompatible declaration on some platforms:
Solaris 11.4 (when @code{_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS} is not defined).
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, this function may not
work correctly on huge directories 2 GiB and larger.  Also, on platforms
where @code{ino_t} is a 32-bit type, this function may report inode numbers
incorrectly.  This can occur with file systems such as XFS (typically on
large disks) and NFS@.  @xref{Large File Support}.
