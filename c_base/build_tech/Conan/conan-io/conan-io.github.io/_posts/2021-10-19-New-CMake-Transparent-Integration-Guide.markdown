title: "Conan's New CMake integration offers a transparent experience"
description: "In the roadmap to Conan 2.0 Conan introduced a new approach to create a Conan package based on CMake"
---

The CMake ecosystem and Conan have continually evolved since their conception. Building on this evolution we are pleased to present a new unified way to create Conan packages with CMake. In the near future these new generators will be introduced in the [conan-center-index](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index).


## A Bit of History…

Back in the day when Conan was first created the CMake approach was based on "global variables." The concepts of "modern CMake" and "Targets" didn’t exist or were very uncommon.

We created the first `cmake` generator to address this issue. The way to consume Conan packages with the [cmake](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/generators/cmake.html) generator was including a `conanbuildinfo.cmake` file and calling a `conan_basic_setup()` macro that adjusted the necessary CMake global variables to locate the include directories, the libraries to link with, and so on.

Later the [cmake_multi](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/generators/cmakemulti.html) generator gave support to multi-config projects like Visual Studio creating different `conanbuildinfo.cmake` files for `Release` or `Debug`.

The usage of `find_package()` in the CMake community was getting popular, so we created the `cmake_find_package` generator. Conan generates different `FindXXX.cmake` modules for each dependency, so you could call `find_package(XXX)` and a [bunch of variables](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/generators/cmake_find_package.html#variables-in-find-pkg-name-cmake) were set, so you could link with your requirements.

Soon, a new concept called "modern CMake" was raised. The "target approach" assumed that global variables should not be used, and all the information about a library or executable should be associated with a "target."

That's why we created the `cmake_find_package_multi`, based on targets, config files instead of modules, and it was able to support multi-configuration projects, using [generator expressions](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html).

Finally, we created the `cmake_paths` generator to point the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` and `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` to the packages, in order to support people packaging modules and config cmake files in the Conan packages.

Too many CMake integrations, right?


## A New Approach

We had so many CMake integrations but we felt like we were missing something. We wanted to have the same user experience and results when building a CMake project no matter if doing a `conan create`, or developing a library calling "cmake" in the command line, or clicking a "build" button in the IDE.

To help resolve this missing piece we introduced two new generators:

* The [CMakeToolchain](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/cmake/cmaketoolchain.html) generator to create a `conan_toolchain.cmake`. This file is saved after a `conan install` based on the settings and options and can be used like any other CMake toolchain:


```bash
$ cmake . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake
```

* The [CMakeDeps](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/cmake/cmakedeps.html) generator, to manage the requirements and to generate the config and/or module files we created.


## How to Migrate the Recipes

After the release of Conan 2.0 the only CMake integration will be `CMakeToolchain` + `CMakeDeps`. These generators are already supported in Conan 1.40 and we will keep improving them in every release. We are hard at work to introduce these generators in the recipes of [conan-center-index](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index) as soon as possible.

For more information you can check the [Creating packages getting started](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/creating_packages/getting_started.html).


### Namespace change

The imports from the new integrations are in the `conan.tools` namespace, not in the <code>conan**s**</code>.

```python
from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain, CMakeDeps
```

### The <code>generate()</code> method.

One important change in the "Conan 2.0 compatible recipes" is the `generate()` method. This method is responsible for generating all the files needed so the build helpers (at the `build()` method) can almost directly call the build system without any calculation. This enables the user to get the same build results in a `conan create` or building in the command line.


```python
from conans import ConanFile
from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain, CMakeDeps, CMake

class HelloConan(ConanFile):
    name = "hello"
    version = "0.1"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    requires = "foo/1.0", "bar/2.0"

    def generate(self):
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        # This writes the "conan_toolchain.cmake"
        tc.generate()


        deps = CMakeDeps(self)
        # This writes all the config files (xxx-config.cmake)
        deps.generate()

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.configure()
        cmake.build()

    ...
```


As we are not adjusting anything in the _CMakeToolchain_ nor in the _CMakeDeps_, the previous example can be simplified to:


```python
from conans import ConanFile
from conan.tools.cmake import CMake

class HelloConan(ConanFile):
    name = "hello"
    version = "0.1"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    requires = "foo/1.0", "bar/2.0"
    generators = "CMakeToolchain", "CMakeDeps"

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.configure()
        cmake.build()

    ...    
```



### Customizing the `CMakeToolchain`

The most common code to change is the `.definitions` from the old `CMake()` build helper. You have to migrate to the toolchain as `.variables`:

From:

```python
from conans import ConanFile, CMake

class HelloConan(ConanFile):
    name = "hello"
    version = "0.1"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    options = {"xxx_feature_enabled": [True, False]}
    default_options = {"xxx_feature_enabled": False}
    requires = "foo/1.0", "bar/2.0"
    generators = "cmake_find_package", "cmake_find_package_multi", "cmake" # any of them

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.definitions["DISABLE_XXX_FEATURE"] = not self.options.xxx_feature_enabled
        cmake.configure()
        cmake.build()

    ...
```

To:

```python
from conans import ConanFile
from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain, CMake

class HelloConan(ConanFile):
    name = "hello"
    version = "0.1"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    options = {"xxx_feature_enabled": [True, False]}
    default_options = {"xxx_feature_enabled": False}
    requires = "foo/1.0", "bar/2.0"
    generators = "CMakeDeps"

    def generate(self):
      toolchain = CMakeToolchain(self)
      toolchain.variables["DISABLE_XXX_FEATURE"] = not self.options.xxx_feature_enabled
      toolchain.generate()
```


See the [full CMakeToolchain reference](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/cmake/cmaketoolchain.html) for all the customization.


### Customizing the `CMakeDeps`

* At the `generate()` method there are some new things you can now adjust, like adding new custom user CMake configurations besides the standard ones (Release, Debug, etc) with `cmake.configurations` and selecting the current configuration with `cmake.configuration`:


```python
def generate(self):
    cmake = CMakeDeps(self)
    cmake.configurations.append("ReleaseShared")
    if self.options["hello"].shared:
        cmake.configuration = "ReleaseShared"
    cmake.generate()
```


To elaborate on this, see the [full CMakeDeps reference](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/cmake/cmakedeps.html).


* At the `package_info()` method, there are several [properties](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/cmake/cmakedeps.html#properties) you can configure to indicate to the generator how to behave when a consumer uses it (having a requirement to your package). Here is an example:


```python
def package_info(self):
    ...
    # Generate MyFileName-config.cmake
    self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_file_name", "MyFileName")
    # Foo:: namespace for the targets (Foo::Foo if no components)
    self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_target_name", "Foo")
    # self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_target_namespace", "Foo")  # This can be omitted as the value is the same

    # Foo::Var target name for the component "mycomponent"
    self.cpp_info.components["mycomponent"].set_property("cmake_target_name", "Var")
    # Automatically include the lib/mypkg.cmake file when calling find_package()
    self.cpp_info.components["mycomponent"].set_property("cmake_build_modules", [os.path.join("lib", "mypkg.cmake")])

    # Skip this package when generating the files for the whole dependency tree in the consumer
    # note: it will make useless the previous adjustements.
    # self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_find_mode", "none")

    # Generate both MyFileName-config.cmake and FindMyFileName.cmake
    self.cpp_info.set_property("cmake_find_mode", "both")
```


### The `CMake` Build Helper

To leverage the new `CMakeToolchain` and `CMakeDeps` you have to import the new [CMake](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/cmake/cmake.html) build helper from the new `conan.tools.cmake` namespace.

This build helper only calls `cmake` passing the `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake`.

As this build helper has no internal state anymore, there is an anti-pattern to avoid: keeping an instance of the build helper to use in the `build()` method and later in the `package()` method. This is considered an anti-pattern, because keeping the state between the methods of the recipe might fail in the conan local methods like `conan build` + `conan export-pkg` where the execution is isolated.

From:


```python
from conans import ConanFile, CMake, tools

class HelloConan(ConanFile):
    name = "hello"
    version = "0.1"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    _cmake = None

    ...

    def _configure_cmake(self):
        if not hasattr(self, "_cmake"):
            self._cmake = CMake(self)
            self._cmake.definitions["tests"] = False
            self._cmake.configure()
        return self._cmake

    def build(self):
        cmake = self._configure_cmake()
        cmake.build()

    def package(self):
        cmake = self._configure_cmake()
        cmake.install()

    ...
```


To:


```python
from conans import ConanFile
from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain, CMake

class HelloConan(ConanFile):
    name = "hello"
    version = "0.1"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"

    def generate(self):
        toolchain = CMakeToolchain(self)
        toolchain.variables["tests"] = False
        toolchain.generate()

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake()
        cmake.configure()
        cmake.build()

    def package(self):
        cmake = CMake()
        cmake.install()
```



### The `layout()` method

You can declare a <code>[layout()](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/developing_packages/package_layout.html)</code> method in the recipe to describe the package contents, not only the final package in the cache but also the package while developing. As the package will have the same structure in the cache and in our local directory, the recipe development becomes easier, even working with editable packages out of the box.

A couple of classic patterns you can avoid using the `layout()` method are the following:

From:

**conandata.yml**


```yaml
...

patches:
  "0.1":
    - patch_file: "patches/001-fix-curl-define.patch"
      base_path: "source_subfolder"
```


**conanfile.py**


```python
from conans import ConanFile, CMake, tools

class HelloConan(ConanFile):
    name = "hello"
    version = "0.1"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    exports_sources = ["patches/**"]

    @property
    def _source_subfolder(self):
        return "source_subfolder"

    @property
    def _build_subfolder(self):
        return "build_subfolder"


    def source(self):
        tools.get("https://www.foo.bar/sources.tgz")
        extracted_dir = "{}-{}".format(self.name, self.version)
        os.rename(extracted_dir, self._source_subfolder)
        for patch in self.conan_data.get("patches", {}).get(self.version, []):
            tools.patch(**patch)


    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake()
        cmake.configure(build_folder=self._build_subfolder, source_folder=self._source_subfolder)
        cmake.build()
    ...
```


To:

**conandata.yml**


```yaml
...

patches:
  "0.1":
    - patch_file: "patches/001-fix-curl-define.patch"
```


**conanfile.py**


```python
from conans import ConanFile
from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain, CMake
from conan.tools.layout import cmake_layout
from conan.tools.files import apply_conandata_patches

class HelloConan(ConanFile):
    name = "hello"
    version = "0.1"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    generators = "CMakeToolchain"
    exports_sources = ["patches/**"]

    def layout(self):
        cmake_layout(self)
        self.folders.source = "{}-{}".format(self.name, self.version)

    def source(self):
        tools.get("https://www.foo.bar/sources.tgz")
        apply_conandata_patches(self)

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake()
        cmake.configure()
        cmake.build()
```


In the previous example, we used a predefined layout, the `cmake_layout`. See more information about [cmake_layout](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/layout.html#predefined-layouts).

You can adjust any value after calling it to match your package structure.

Also the new tool [apply_conandata_patches](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/files.html#conan-tools-files-apply-conandata-patches) already knows where to locate the sources thanks to the `layout`, so the _base_path_ can be omitted in the `conandata.yml` file.

See the [layout()](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/developing_packages/package_layout.html) to learn more about it.


### Access to the Dependencies

Sometimes in a recipe you need to access the dependencies to check something, typically the version and the root package folder. Previously this could be done by accessing the `deps_cpp_info` object in almost any method of the recipe. With the new model the access to the dependencies should be done at the `generate()` and the `validate()` methods, using the new `self.dependencies` object.

In the `generate(self)`:

From:


```python
from conans import ConanFile, CMake

class HelloConan(ConanFile):
    name = "hello"
    version = "0.1"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    requires = "foo/1.0"

    def build(self):
        cmake = CMake(self)
        cmake.definitions["FOO_ROOT_DIR"] = self.deps_cpp_info["foo"].rootpath
        cmake.configure()
        cmake.build()

    ...
```


To:


```python
from conans import ConanFile
from conan.tools.cmake import CMakeToolchain, CMake

class HelloConan(ConanFile):
    name = "hello"
    version = "0.1"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    requires = "foo/1.0", "bar/2.0"
    generators = "CMakeDeps"

    def generate(self):
        toolchain = CMakeToolchain(self)
        toolchain.variables["FOO_ROOT_DIR"] = self.dependencies["foo"].package_folder


        # Other possible dependencies access
        # info = self.dependencies["foo"].cpp_info
        # include_dirs = info.includedirs
        #
        # ref = self.dependencies["foo"].ref
        # version = ref.version

        toolchain.generate()
```


In the `validate(self)` method:


```python
from conans import ConanFile

class HelloConan(ConanFile):
    name = "hello"
    version = "0.1"
    settings = "os", "compiler", "build_type", "arch"
    requires = "foo/1.0"

    def validate(self):
        if self.dependencies["foo"].ref.version == "1.2":
            raise ConanInvalidConfiguration("Foo 1.2 not supported")


        if self.dependencies["foo"].options.shared:
            raise ConanInvalidConfiguration("Foo shared not supported")
```


See the [complete reference](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/dependencies.html?highlight=dependencies#dependencies) of the `self.dependencies` object.


### Conclusion

This blog post provided highlights about the new CMake integration. Please note that the `layout()`, the `generate()`, the `self.dependencies`, the patches, etc, are common to other integrations like the new [Autotools](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/gnu.html), [MSBuild](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools/microsoft.html), etc.

With all these new improvements we want to provide syntax compatible recipes with the coming Conan 2.0 to help to migrate them before the release.

We have been evolving and improving this model for some releases now and these features should not suffer important interface changes before 2.0, but please take into account that they are still experimental and subject to breaking changes as noticed in the documentation.

See the new [conan.tools namespace](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile/tools.html) to learn more about all the new integrations.
