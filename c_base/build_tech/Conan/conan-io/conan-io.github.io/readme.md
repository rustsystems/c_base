- Preview in local:

```sh
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev zlib1g-dev
sudo gem install github-pages
jekyll serve _config.yml --watch
```

If you are writing a post with a future publication date and you want to check
it out in local, pass `--future` to jekyll. Otherwise, it won't be generated
until the publication date:

```sh
jekyll serve _config.yml --watch --future
```

- Create new post: Just create the file with the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md

## Post Front Matter

Each post needs a few fields and there are optional fields as well for SEO optimization

```yaml
---
layout: post
comments: false
title: "Short meaningful title to display on the web page"
meta_title: "(optional) A longer more descriptive title for search engines to index"
description: "A short summary of the post that will be displayed in the search engine results"
last_modified_at: "(optional) the date the post was last updated to improve search results and relevance"
keywords: "(optional) comma, separated, values, for seo optimization"
---
```
