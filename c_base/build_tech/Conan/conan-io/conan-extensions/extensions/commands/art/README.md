## Artifactory commands

> ⚠️ Warning: These custom commands are experimental. They are under development and are subject to breaking changes.

These are commands to manage certain Artifactory features:

- [``conan art:server``](readme_server.md): Manages Artifactory server urls and credentials.
  - ``add``
  -  ``list``
  -  ``remove``

- [``conan art:build-info``](readme_build_info.md): Manages JFrog Build Info (https://www.buildinfo.org/).
  - ``append``
  - ``create``
  - ``create-bundle``
  - ``delete``
  - ``get``
  - ``promote``
  - ``upload``

- [``conan art:property``](readme_property.md). Manages artifacts properties in Artifactory.
  - ``add``
  - ``set``


### How to manage Build Info's in Artifactory

#### 1. Configure your Artifactory server

Firstly, configure your Artifactory server with the url and credentials you want to use (this will come handy in the next commands):

```
conan art:server add my_artifactory --user=<user> --password=<pass>
```

#### 2. Create build infos for your binaries

Now, get a JSON output from a package build. This could come from a ``conan install`` or a ``conan create``:

```
conan create . --format json -s build_type=Release > create_release.json
conan create . --format json -s build_type=Debug > create_debug.json
```

Then upload the created package to your repository:

```
conan upload ... -c -r ...
```

Using the generated JSON files you can create a Build Info JSON file. To do this, you need to provide the build
name and number. You will also need to indicate the artifactory server to use:

```
conan art:build-info create create_release.json mybuildname_release 1 <repo> --server my_artifactory --with-dependencies > mybuildname_release.json
conan art:build-info create create_debug.json mybuildname_debug 1 <repo> --server my_artifactory --with-dependencies > mybuildname_debug.json
```

### 3. Upload the build infos to your Artifactory server

Finally, you can upload the Build Info's:

```
conan art:build-info upload mybuildname_release.json --server my_artifactory
conan art:build-info upload mybuildname_debug.json <url> --server my_artifactory
```

### 4. Aggregate build infos into one

In this case we generated two Build Info's, for Release and Debug, but we can also merge those to
create a new Build Info that aggregates that information:

```
conan art:build-info append mybuildname_aggregated 1 --build-info=mybuildname_release,1 --build-info=mybuildname_debug,1 --server my_artifactory > mybuildname_aggregated.json
conan art:build-info upload mybuildname_aggregated.json --server my_artifactory"
```

This is handy in order to make promotions of packages from one repository to another in Artifactory.

### 5. Promote all the binaries of the aggregated build info

```
conan art:build-info promote mybuildname_aggregated 1 origin-repo destination-repo --server my_artifactory}
```

Now, both release and debug binaries from that pacakge ae available in the destination repository with just one command.
