**WARNING**: This training is **deprecated** and no longer recommended to learn Conan. It was a 1.X training, but Conan 2.0 has been out for several months now.
This training might not work, the infrastructure might fail, the packages in ConanCenter might fail, and the videos might not match the documentation anymore.

The recommended way to learn Conan is the 2.0 documentation in https://docs.conan.io, and specially the **tutorial** there.
